# Story 3.2: Group Interface Pin Generation

## Story Description

**As a** user, **I want** groups to automatically create appropriate input/output pins, **so that** grouped functionality integrates seamlessly with the rest of my graph.

### Context
This story builds on Story 3.1's basic group creation to add intelligent interface generation. When nodes are grouped, the system must analyze external connections and automatically create interface pins on the group container, maintaining seamless data flow with the broader graph. This is critical for preserving graph functionality while enabling organizational benefits of grouping.

### Background
The existing pin system in PyFlowGraph supports type inference and dynamic pin creation from function signatures. Groups must extend this system to automatically generate interface pins based on connection analysis, ensuring no data flow is broken during grouping operations. The pin generation logic must handle complex scenarios including multiple connection types, data transformation, and connection routing.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Analyze external connections to determine required group interface pins
**Given** a group is created from selected nodes  
**When** nodes have connections to external nodes  
**Then** system identifies all crossing connections and required interface points with proper type analysis

### AC2: Auto-generate input pins for connections entering the group
**Given** external nodes connect to internal group nodes  
**When** group is created  
**Then** input pins are automatically generated on group boundary with appropriate naming and positioning

### AC3: Auto-generate output pins for connections leaving the group
**Given** internal group nodes connect to external nodes  
**When** group is created  
**Then** output pins are automatically generated on group boundary with clear output labeling

### AC4: Pin type inference based on connected pin types
**Given** external connections have specific data types  
**When** group interface pins are generated  
**Then** pins inherit appropriate types from connected pins with validation and error handling

### AC5: Group interface pins maintain connection relationships with internal nodes
**Given** group interface pins are created  
**When** data flows through the group  
**Then** connections properly route between interface pins and internal nodes preserving data integrity
