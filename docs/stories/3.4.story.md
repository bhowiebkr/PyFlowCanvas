# Story 3.4: Group Expansion and Internal Navigation

## Story Description

**As a** user, **I want** to expand groups to see and edit internal nodes, **so that** I can modify grouped functionality when needed.

### Context
This story completes Epic 3 by implementing the expansion functionality that allows users to dive into grouped content for editing and modification. This includes navigation patterns and visual cues that help users understand their location within nested graph structures. The expansion system must provide intuitive navigation while maintaining spatial relationships and user orientation.

### Background
Building on the collapse functionality from Story 3.3, this story enables the reverse operation - expanding collapsed groups to reveal internal content. The navigation system must provide clear visual feedback about the user's location in the graph hierarchy, similar to file system navigation patterns. Users must be able to seamlessly transition between collapsed and expanded views while preserving their workflow context.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Double-click or context menu option to expand groups
**Given** a collapsed group node exists  
**When** user double-clicks or uses context menu "Expand Group"  
**Then** group transitions to expanded state showing internal content with smooth visual transition

### AC2: Breadcrumb navigation with detailed interaction behavior
**Given** user is viewing inside an expanded group  
**When** group is displayed  
**Then** breadcrumb navigation shows:
- Full hierarchy path (Root > Group1 > SubGroup2)
- Clickable segments for direct navigation to any level
- Current location highlighted with distinct styling
- Hover states and tooltips showing group descriptions
- Maximum path length handling with ellipsis for deep nesting

### AC3: Internal nodes restore to original positions within group boundary
**Given** a group is expanded  
**When** internal content is displayed  
**Then** nodes appear in their original positions with proper spatial relationships and connection preservation

### AC4: Visual boundary indication showing group extent when expanded
**Given** a group is in expanded state  
**When** viewing the group content  
**Then** visual boundary clearly delineates group area from rest of graph with distinctive styling

### AC5: Ability to exit group view and return to parent graph level
**Given** user is viewing inside an expanded group  
**When** user clicks breadcrumb or uses "Exit Group" action  
**Then** view returns to parent level with group in collapsed state and proper view restoration

### AC6: Navigation state preservation and undo support
**Given** user navigates between group levels  
**When** using undo/redo or navigation history  
**Then** view state (pan, zoom, selection) is preserved and properly restored for each level

### AC7: Performance requirements for expansion operations
**Given** groups with up to 50 internal nodes and 5 nesting levels  
**When** expanding or navigating between levels  
**Then** operations complete within 1 second with smooth visual transitions
