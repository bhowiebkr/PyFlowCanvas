# Story 3.3: Group Collapse and Visual Representation

## Story Description

**As a** user, **I want** groups to display as single nodes when collapsed, **so that** I can reduce visual complexity while maintaining functionality.

### Context
This story implements the visual collapse functionality that transforms expanded groups into compact single-node representations. This is essential for managing large graphs by reducing visual clutter while preserving all functional capabilities through the interface pins created in Story 3.2. The collapsed view must maintain professional visual standards while clearly communicating group status and available interactions.

### Background
PyFlowGraph's existing node rendering system provides a foundation for custom node visualization through QGraphicsItem inheritance. Groups in collapsed state must render as visually distinct nodes that clearly indicate their group nature while supporting all standard node operations. The visual design must be intuitive, following established UI patterns while introducing group-specific styling elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Collapsed groups render as single nodes with group-specific styling
**Given** a group exists in expanded state  
**When** user collapses the group  
**Then** group renders as single node with distinct visual styling differentiating it from regular nodes

### AC2: Group title and description displayed prominently
**Given** a group is in collapsed state  
**When** viewing the group node  
**Then** group name and description are clearly visible with appropriate typography and layout

### AC3: Interface pins arranged logically on group node boundaries
**Given** a collapsed group has interface pins  
**When** viewing the group node  
**Then** input pins appear on left, output pins on right with clear labeling and proper spacing

### AC4: Visual indication of group status with appropriate icons
**Given** a group node exists  
**When** viewing the node  
**Then** visual indicators show collapsed/expanded state and group type using Font Awesome icons

### AC5: Group nodes support standard node operations
**Given** a collapsed group node  
**When** user performs standard operations (move, select, copy, delete)  
**Then** group behaves like any other node with proper visual feedback and operation support

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Existing Node Visual System Architecture
- **Node Base Class**: `src/core/node.py` provides QGraphicsItem foundation with custom painting
- **Visual Styling**: Established color schemes, fonts, and visual hierarchy patterns
- **Rendering System**: `paint()` method override for custom node visualization
- **Font Awesome Integration**: `src/ui/utils/ui_utils.py` provides icon creation utilities
[Source: src/core/node.py paint methods, src/ui/utils/ui_utils.py create_fa_icon]

#### Group Visual Design Requirements
- **Distinct Styling**: Groups must be visually distinct from regular nodes through color, borders, shadows
- **Professional Appearance**: Maintain PyFlowGraph's clean, technical aesthetic
- **Scalability**: Visual design must work across different zoom levels and graph sizes
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual hierarchy and readable typography at various sizes
[Source: docs/specifications/ui-ux-specifications.md, existing node styling patterns]

#### GroupNode Class Architecture
- **Inheritance**: GroupNode extends QGraphicsItem for custom rendering and interaction
- **State Management**: Track collapsed/expanded state with visual state transitions
- **Geometry**: Dynamic bounding rectangle based on title, description, and interface pins
- **Event Handling**: Mouse events for selection, movement, and interaction
[Source: src/core/node.py patterns, QGraphicsItem documentation]

#### Interface Pin Visual Integration
- **Pin Positioning**: Interface pins positioned on group boundaries (inputs left, outputs right)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Pins clearly associated with group while maintaining individual identity
- **Labeling System**: Pin names and types displayed with proper spacing and typography
- **Dynamic Layout**: Layout adapts to varying numbers of interface pins
[Source: Story 3.2 interface pin requirements, src/core/pin.py visual patterns]

#### Visual State Management
- **Collapse State**: Boolean state tracking with visual representation changes
- **State Indicators**: Font Awesome icons indicating collapsed/expanded status
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth visual transitions between states (optional enhancement)
- **Persistence**: State preservation in group serialization and file formats
[Source: src/core/group.py state management, existing serialization patterns]

#### File Locations & Structure
- **Group Node**: `src/core/group_node.py` - New visual representation class
- **Group Class**: `src/core/group.py` - Extend with visual state management
- **Visual Utils**: Extend `src/ui/utils/ui_utils.py` for group-specific styling utilities
- **Node Graph**: `src/core/node_graph.py` - Update for GroupNode rendering integration
- **Test Files**: `tests/test_group_visual.py` (new), extend group system tests
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md, established patterns]

#### Integration Points with Existing Systems
- **Node Graph Rendering**: Update NodeGraph.addItem() and rendering cycles for GroupNode
- **Selection System**: Integrate GroupNode with existing selectedItems() and selection highlighting
- **Context Menu**: Extend context menu system for group-specific operations
- **Copy/Paste**: Extend clipboard operations to handle collapsed group serialization
[Source: src/core/node_graph.py rendering, src/ui/editor/node_editor_view.py context menu]

#### Color Scheme and Visual Design
- **Primary Colors**: Distinct color palette for group nodes (suggested: blue/teal theme)
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper size hierarchy for titles and descriptions
- **Borders**: Distinctive border styling (thicker, different style) to indicate group nature
- **Icons**: Font Awesome icons for collapse/expand state (fa-compress/fa-expand)
[Source: existing UI color schemes, Font Awesome icon library]

#### Performance Considerations
- **Rendering Speed**: GroupNode painting must be efficient for graphs with many groups
- **Memory Usage**: Visual representation should not significantly increase memory footprint
- **Update Frequency**: Minimize repainting and updates for better performance
- **Large Groups**: Visual system must handle groups with many interface pins efficiently
[Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements NFR1, NFR2]

#### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Zoom Levels**: Visual elements must remain readable and functional across zoom ranges
- **Pin Density**: Interface pin layout must handle high pin counts gracefully
- **Text Overflow**: Title and description text must handle overflow with ellipsis or wrapping
- **Minimum Size**: Collapsed groups must have minimum readable size constraints
