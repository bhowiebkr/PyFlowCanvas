# PyFlowGraph Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Implement comprehensive Undo/Redo system providing 40-60% reduction in error recovery time
- Deliver Node Grouping/Container functionality enabling 5-10x larger graph management
- Achieve feature parity with professional node editors, moving PyFlowGraph from "interesting prototype" to "viable tool"
- Enable management of graphs with 200+ nodes effectively through abstraction layers
- Establish foundation for professional adoption by addressing critical competitive disadvantages

### Background Context

PyFlowGraph is a universal node-based visual scripting editor built with Python and PySide6, following a "Code as Nodes" philosophy. Positioned as a workflow automation and integration platform, it enables users to build ETL pipelines, API integrations, data transformations, webhook handlers, and business process automation through visual programming. Currently, it lacks two fundamental features that every professional workflow automation tool provides: Undo/Redo functionality and Node Grouping capabilities. Market analysis reveals that 100% of competitors in the workflow automation space have both features, and user feedback consistently cites these as deal-breakers for professional adoption. This PRD addresses these critical gaps to transform PyFlowGraph into a professional-grade workflow automation platform capable of handling complex enterprise integration scenarios.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Professional desktop application feel with modern dark theme aesthetics. The interface should feel familiar to users of other node editors (Blender Shader Editor, Unreal Blueprint) while maintaining PyFlowGraph's unique "Code as Nodes" philosophy. Prioritize efficiency for power users while remaining approachable for newcomers to visual scripting.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Node-based visual programming with drag-and-drop connections
- Context-sensitive right-click menus for rapid access to functions
- Keyboard shortcuts for all major operations (professionals expect this)
- Pan/zoom navigation for large graphs with smooth transitions
- Multi-selection with standard Ctrl+Click and drag-rectangle patterns
- Visual feedback for all state changes (hover, selection, execution)

### Core Screens and Views
- Main Graph Editor (primary workspace with node canvas)
- Code Editor Dialog (modal Python code editing with syntax highlighting)
- Node Properties Dialog (node configuration and metadata)
- Group Navigation View (breadcrumb-based hierarchy navigation)
- Undo History Dialog (visual undo timeline)
- Group Template Manager (save/load/organize group templates)
- Settings/Preferences Dialog (keyboard shortcuts, appearance, behavior)

### Accessibility: None
No specific accessibility requirements for this MVP iteration.

### Branding
Maintain PyFlowGraph's existing dark theme aesthetic with professional color scheme. Use Font Awesome icons for consistency. Ensure visual distinction between different node types through color coding and iconography.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only
Windows, Linux, macOS desktop applications with mouse and keyboard as primary input methods. Minimum screen resolution 1920x1080 for comfortable large graph editing.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all PyFlowGraph components. Current structure with src/, tests/, docs/, examples/ will be maintained and extended for new features.

### Service Architecture
Monolithic desktop application architecture using PySide6 Qt framework. All functionality integrated into single executable with modular internal architecture based on existing patterns (node system, execution engine, UI components).

### Testing Requirements
Comprehensive testing approach following existing patterns: Unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for component interaction, GUI tests for user workflows. Maintain current fast execution model (<5 seconds total) with new test coverage for undo/redo and grouping features.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Language:** Python 3.8+ maintaining current compatibility requirements
- **GUI Framework:** Continue with PySide6 for cross-platform desktop consistency
- **Architecture Pattern:** Implement Command Pattern for undo/redo functionality
- **Data Persistence:** Extend existing Markdown flow format for group metadata
- **Performance:** Leverage existing QGraphicsView framework optimizations
- **Dependencies:** Minimize new external dependencies - prefer built-in Qt functionality
- **File Format:** Backward compatibility with existing .md graph files required
- **Execution:** Maintain existing subprocess isolation model for node execution
- **Memory Management:** Use Qt's parent-child hierarchy for automatic cleanup
- **Code Style:** Follow established patterns in docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
