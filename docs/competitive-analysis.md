# PyFlowGraph Competitive Analysis

This document outlines missing features identified through competitive analysis with other visual scripting tools.

## Search and Navigation

### Missing Features
- Node search palette (Ctrl+Space or Tab)
- Minimap for large graphs
- Bookmarks/markers for quick navigation
- Jump to node by name/type
- Breadcrumb navigation for nested graphs

### Competitive Context
Standard in most node editors like Blender, Houdini, and Unreal Engine.

## Node Library and Discovery

### Missing Features
- Categorized node browser
- Favorite/recent nodes panel
- Node documentation tooltips
- Quick node creation from connection drag
- Context-sensitive node suggestions

### Competitive Context
Essential for discoverability in complex visual scripting environments.

## Graph Organization

### Missing Features
- Alignment and distribution tools
- Auto-layout algorithms
- Comment boxes/sticky notes
- Node coloring/tagging system
- Wire organization (reroute nodes exist but need improvement)

### Competitive Context
Basic organizational tools found in all professional node editors.

## Data and Type System

### Missing Features
- Type conversion nodes
- Generic/template nodes
- Custom type definitions
- Array/list operations
- Type validation and error highlighting

### Competitive Context
Advanced type systems are differentiators in tools like Houdini and newer visual scripting platforms.

## Collaboration and Sharing

### Missing Features
- Export/import node groups as packages

### Missing Features
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Multiple selection modes
- Context-sensitive right-click menus
- Duplicate with connections (Alt+drag)
- Quick connect (Q key connecting)
- Zoom to fit/zoom to selection
- Multiple graph tabs

### Competitive Context
Basic UX improvements found across modern visual scripting tools.

## Advanced Execution Features

### Missing Features
- Conditional execution paths
- Loop constructs with visual feedback
- Error handling and recovery nodes
- Async/await support
- External trigger integration
- Scheduling and automation

### Competitive Context
Advanced execution features separate professional tools from educational ones.

## Developer Features

### Missing Features
- API for custom node creation
- Plugin system for extensions
- Scripting interface for automation
- Unit testing framework for graphs
- CI/CD integration for graph validation

### Competitive Context
Extensibility features are key for adoption in professional development environments.
